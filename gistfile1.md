Every now and then I see someone ask how much of an impact open-source work can really have on employment.  I thought I'd compile a list as I came across people for whom open-source proved not only a reason, but the *primary* reason they now receive a paycheck.

In no particular order:

# Job Offer

* [Mitch Garnaat](https://github.com/garnaat) - [Amazon](http://www.elastician.com/2011/12/looking-at-clouds-from-both-sides-now.html) ([boto](http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/))

# Funding without Employment

* Mike Pall - [corporate sponsorship](http://luajit.org/sponsors.html) ([LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/))
* [Eric Holscher](http://ericholscher.com/about/) - [Gittip](http://ericholscher.com/blog/2013/sep/25/help-me-improve-documentation/) ([Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/))
